# PHP 2550 Project 1

## Description 

The project explores the impact of smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on children's self-regulation, externalizing behaviors, and substance use. It delves into how early exposure to smoke might affect children's tendencies towards ADHD, substance experimentation, and difficulties in self-regulation, encompassing emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. After pre-processing the dataset, it focuses on 49 observations across 78 variables related to demographics and smoke exposure for mothers and children. Tests like the Brief Problem Monitor, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and SWAN scores for ADHD were utilized. The exploratory analysis suggests that SDP appears to influence a child's self-regulation and externalizing behaviors negatively. While there's an indication that heavy smoking by mothers may relate to increased substance experimentation in children, these instances were identified as outliers. ETS seems to impact a child's emotional control and behavioral tendencies but lacks consistency across all tests. Notably, these conclusions were drawn from data examination rather than statistical testing, necessitating further analysis for robust inferences due to the study's limitations in sample size and missing data. Therefore, cautious interpretation is urged, emphasizing the need for future studies with larger and more complete datasets to validate these findings.



## Guideline

In this folder you will find 3 different folders. The folder `Data` contains the codebook for the data used in this project. The folder `Manuscript` contains the pdf report and the `R Code` folder contains the code for reproduction. You will find two files there.the file `project1-try1.R` contains exploratory analysis and some visualization plots not used in the report. The file `project1.qmd` contains all necessary code for reproduction.
